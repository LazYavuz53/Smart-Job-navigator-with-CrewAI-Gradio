# SmartJob Navigator: AI-Powered Career Pathway Assistant with CrewAI

# Project Overview
In this project, we will develop a CrewAI application designed to streamline the job search process. The application will accept the job title and desired salary as inputs, then perform the following tasks:

1- Job Screening: The application will search through Indeed for job listings matching the provided title.
2- Requirement Analysis: It will analyze the job listings to identify the common requirements and skills needed for the role.
3- Skill Recommendation: Based on the analysis, the application will recommend key skills that the user should acquire.
4- Roadmap Creation: It will generate a personalized roadmap for the user to develop the recommended skills and enhance their qualifications for the desired role.
# Features
1- User Input: Users will provide the job title and the salary they are looking for.
2- Automated Job Search: The application will search Indeed for job listings matching the input criteria.
3- Data Analysis: It will analyze the job listings to extract common requirements and skills.
4- Skill Gap Identification: The application will identify the skills the user needs to develop based on the job market analysis.
5- Personalized Roadmap: Users will receive a customized roadmap outlining the steps to acquire the necessary skills and improve their employability for the target job.
# Goals
Simplify the job search process by automating job screening and requirement analysis.
Provide actionable insights into the skills required for specific job titles.

Implementation Plan
1- Collect User Input: Develop a user interface to collect the job title and desired salary.

3- Data Extraction and Analysis: Use web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze job descriptions and extract required skills and qualifications.
4- Skill Recommendation Engine: Create an algorithm to identify the most common skills required for the job and compare them with the user's existing skills.
5- Roadmap Generator: Develop a module to create a personalized skill development roadmap, including recommended courses, certifications, and other learning resources.
6- User Feedback and Iteration: Implement a feedback mechanism for users to refine the recommendations and improve the application over time.
# Conclusion
